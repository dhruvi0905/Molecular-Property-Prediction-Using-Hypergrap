# Molecular-Property-Prediction-Using-Hypergrap
Developed two hypergraph neural network models for molecular property prediction: one using k-cliques and another based on functional groups. Both capture higher-order molecular interactions for improved toxicity prediction, outperforming standard GNNs. Achieved 0.894 ROC AUC on the Tox21 NR-AR dataset. ðŸ§¬
